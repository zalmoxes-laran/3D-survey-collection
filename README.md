# 3D-survey-collection

3D Survey Collection - shortly 3DSC, an addon for Blender 

Hello there! Iâ€™m **3D Survey Collection**, an open source add-on (GPL3) for Blender that simplifies the tasks involved in the management and optimization of the archaeological and architectonic 3D record

I can transform an extensive survey of an archaeological excavation into a real-time oriented asset that can be used inside a Game Engine to create Open World experiences (Unreal, Unity, Godot).

I can:

* dramatically enhance the visual quality of a photogrammetric survey through interactive tools (paint from cameras, color correction)
* integrate different surveys made in different light conditions (color correction, texture patcher)
* segment big models in tiles and create automatically level of details
* manage 3D scene complexity and model a virtual reconstruction hypothesis 
* manage georeferenced GPS and Total station data points
* import and export 3D models with customized tools

I am under constant development by [Emanuel Demetrescu](https://www.ispc.cnr.it/it_it/team/demetrescu-emanuel/) during his research activities at the [CNR-ISPC](http://www.ispc.cnr.it) (Italian National Council for Research, Institute of Heritage Science) (former CNR-ITABC) within the [DHILab](https://www.ispc.cnr.it/it_it/2021/06/16/dhilab-digital-heritage-innovation-lab/).

I need constant improvements and beta testing in real projects, so, developers out there, email my creator at emanuel.demetrescu at cnr dot it or simoneberto at cnr dot it and contribute :-)
